Ensemble Method consists of two types:

-> Bagging (Random Forest)
-> Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost)

    In the image, D is the entire dataset
                  Dm', Dm'', Dm''' are the models 
    The Dataset from D is passed to all the models, here each model is given a small sample data (no two model will have same data sample) from the entire dataset.
    Once the model does all the processes the output is given.
    The voting classifier is used to check for the most common output among all the models and it is considered as the end result.
    
  The step where the dataset from D is getting divided to models (row sampling with replacement) is called Bootstrap.
  The step where the common output is selected as a end result is called Aggregation.
